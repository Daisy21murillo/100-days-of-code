# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 24 

**Task Accomplished:** Today, I didn't code but I decided to enroll in an Apigee Google Cloud course in order to learn more about Apigee. 

**Thoughts:** The course is: API Design and Fundamentals of Google Cloud's Apigee API Platform. I learned about what Apigee is, and the services each product holds. The Apigee platform holds 3 products. 1.)  Apigee Edge 2.) Apigee Sense and, 3.) Apigee Monetization.
 Apigee Edge is an API management platform, it connects the front with the back-end, adds configuration of API proxies, attaches security to the data being transmitted, and has data mapping. There are 3 layers to this product, those are a.) API Services, b.) Developer Services, and c.) Analytics Services. Apigee Sense is an intelligent behavior detection and security product that protects APIs from attacks. It works along with the Apigee Edge product using algorithms that are analyzed from API calls. Lastly, Apigee Monetization, is a solution that recognizes that value of APIs.
